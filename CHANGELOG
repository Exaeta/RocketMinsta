All changes are in the _chronological_ order, not in order of importance.
Contributors of a change are specified in brackets after the change description, comma-separated.
Contributors are listed in descending order of importance/amount of work related to the change.
A question mark following a contributor's name means that I don't remember/exactly know the name of the contributor and just guessing. Probably because I shamelessly stole that certain feature from Xonotic.

* Animated the map/gametype vote screen [Akari]
* In freezetag, frozen players are now able to place Danger waypoints with the fire button [Akari]
* Added some new HUD/scoreboard animations [Akari]
* Integrated features and fixes from NexuizEx 0.3.1, a RocketMinsta v1.5.0 fork: http://naqua.net/p/nex/ [Blitter, Akari]:

* Fixed a crash in the soulmate mutator [Akari]
* In the soulmate mutator, the gems will try to use team-specific spawnpoints if possible [Akari]
* Added server redirection features [Akari]:
	The "redirect" server command: forces one player to connect to a specific server. Takes the player's id as the first argument and the server address or alias as the second argument.
	The "gotoserver" server command: forces all players on the server to connect to a specific server. Takes the server address or alias as the first argument.
	The server admin may define several aliases to be used instead of IPs in the aforementioned commands for convenience, for example:
		set g_explosive_serveralias_coolserver nex.example.com:1337
		set g_explosive_serveralias_crapserver nex.example.com:9001
		// "gotoserver coolserver" is now equivalent to "gotoserver nex.example.com.1337", and so on
	If the gotoserver command is votable, it can be restricted a whitelist of servers specified in the g_explosive_gotoserver_whitelist cvar. Aliases are allowed.

* New options for the grappling hook [Akari]:
	g_explosive_hook_gravity - If enabled, the hook is affected by gravity
